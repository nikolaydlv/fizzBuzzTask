# fizzBuzzTask

Implement and export by default a function that outputs (console.log) to the terminal numbers in the range from begin to end. Wherein:

If the number is divisible by 3 without a remainder, then the word Fizz is displayed instead
If the number is divisible by 5 without a remainder, then the word Buzz is displayed instead
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 without a remainder, then the word FizzBuzz is displayed instead of the number
In other cases, the number itself is displayed

The function takes two parameters (begin and end) that define the beginning and end of the range (inclusive). For simplicity, we assume that these parameters are integers greater than zero. If the range is empty (when begin > end), then the function simply does not print anything.
